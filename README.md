# Privacy-Preserving AI for Healthcare Applications

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a privacy-preserving AI framework for analyzing healthcare data. Techniques such as **federated learning** and **encryption** are being explored to protect patient information while maintaining predictive model performance.

## Current Status
- Researching suitable federated learning and encryption techniques
- Designing model evaluation metrics (accuracy, robustness, privacy)
- Conducting literature review and experimenting with prototype models

## Goals
- Ensure patient data confidentiality
- Maintain predictive accuracy and model performance
- Develop a framework that can be extended for real-world healthcare datasets

## Skills in Progress
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Privacy-Preserving AI Techniques (Federated Learning, Data Encryption)
- Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
